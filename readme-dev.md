Any changes to styles should be done in the _buttons, _mixins, and _popovers style subfolders. These styles are then concatenated into the `.scss` files in other style subfolders (using `grunt concat`, which are in turn compiled into `.css` files in the same directory. This is done to allow for a single `.scss` file and `.css` file to represent each style, while still breaking the styles up into smaller, manageable chunks.
